Accurate-Cyber-Defense-Network-Traffic-Bot is a powerful tool designed to simulate and analyze cybersecurity scenarios by generating a high volume of realistic network traffic. 
This traffic can be used to test firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and other network security tools. 


The bot continuously monitors activity and sends detailed traffic information, including patterns and anomalies, directly to a connected Telegram bot in real-time. 
This feature allows for remote monitoring and immediate alerts. Ideal for cybersecurity professionals, researchers, and penetration testers, this tool enhances situational awareness and 
improves response strategies by mimicking both normal and malicious traffic behaviors in a controlled environment.
